# Optimal Location for Opening a Restaurant
Applied Data Science Capstone

## Introduction

While opening a restaurant can be a very lucrative business, a lot of factors cause many restaurants to close within the first year of opening. These factors could be location, competition, and quality of food.  

The goal of this project is to use the Foursquare API to determine the optimal location to open a Mexican Restaurant. For this problem specifically, location and competition will be determined by where the restaurant will be opened. If there are too many Mexican restaurants the profitability of the restaurant will be decreased. Another factor could be starting the restaurant in a location with higher income, this could increase the profitability.
